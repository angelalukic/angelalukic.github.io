<h1><a href="TRC Demo.exe">Download Game</a></h1>

<p>I am aware as part of this submission's deliverables we were expected to make our game display debugging statistics as well as host our game online using GitHub pages (for example).</p>

<p>However I am unable to do this with the program I am using (<a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/free-programs/rpg-maker-vx-ace-lite">RPG Maker VX Ace Lite</a>).</p>


<p>VX Lite is meant to be a free trial designed to allow people to assess the tool before they invest money into purchasing the full version of the software. I felt that it would be appropriate for me to use this trial version for this first half of the project.</p>

<p>Whilst this free version has been vastly useful in teaching me how to use RPGMaker, I discovered too late that it also limits the amount of customizability you can put into your demo product in order to encourage you to buy the full version. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot add ANY custom scripts, which means I cannot add my own programming to the game at all. This means I cannot display the FPS of the game or other basic development statistics.</li>
<li>I cannot add custom button mapping, so for example I can't toggle a debug mode or make it so when a developer presses a certain button then development statistics are displayed.</li>
</ul>	

<p>Furthermore, I do not believe there is a way for me to host a game as an .exe online, which means I cannot meet this part of the deliverable. I have made a GitHub page and also made it so a user can download the .exe file, however I cannot do any more than this.</p>

<p>I have tried to include a cheating room that a developer can use to test certain parts of the game (if you touch the green crystal in the overworld or the blue crystal in the cave you should be taken to it). This is the best I can do in terms of developer statistics/merchanics.</p> 

<p>The latest version of RPG Maker called "RPG Maker MV" does allow you to export your game in a format which is compatible for GitHub pages, and since it is the full version of the software it will also allow me to do custom button mapping and scripting. I have purchased this software ready for the second half of the coursework. There is sadly no way for me to convert my VX Ace Lite project into an MV project.</p>

<p>I hope you understand and do not dock me severely for not being able to meet all the deliverables due to the limitations in my software rather than myself. I have discussed this over email with Graham Morgan and I have been informed that I should be okay. I believe I have come as close to the specification as I can with the software I chose to use.</p>
